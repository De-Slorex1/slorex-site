                    As a consumer, you probably have a lot of questions about laptops. Can they be used as a replacement for your desktop? Do they offer enough performance for most people? Can they compete with tablets? In this article, we'll take a look at some of the most common concerns and answer them with some helpful information about laptops.

                    Can Laptops Replace Desktops?

                    A lot of people think that laptops are just for mobile users who want to be able to work on the go. But these days, it's rare to find someone who doesn't use their laptop at least some of the time.

                    Most people spend between four and eight hours per day in front of their computers, according to research from Gartner. So if you're not using your laptop as a desktop replacement today, you're doing something wrong.

                    If you're looking for more flexibility when it comes to working on the go, then tablets may be right for you. They're portable enough that you can take them with you wherever your day takes you without worrying about whether or not they'll get damaged during transport or while in transit (which makes them better than laptops).<br>
